# recycascan-api
I came up with the idea for a recycling mobile app that allows a user to scan the barcode of waste packaging and inform how to recycle it. The app also has a calendar feature showing the userâ€™s next bin collections and a map feature showing their nearest local recycling centres. Building the frontend involved learning React Native, and the backend was built using MongoDB and hosted using Heroku. I also designed the logo and graphics for the whole app.
## Running on a local machine
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
To run this project you will need node v7.4.0 installed on your machine.
### Installing
Please follow this step by step guide to get a development env running.

Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/apmorris83/recycascan-api.git
```
Change into the directory
```
cd recycascan-api
```
Install dependencies
```
npm install or yarn install
```
## Running the tests
To run the automated tests use the mongod command in a separate terminal window. This is the primary daemon process for the MongoDB system. It handles data requests, manages data access, and performs background management operations.
```
mongod
```
Back in the recycascan-api terminal window, use npm test to run the tests
```
npm test
```
